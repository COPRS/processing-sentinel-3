# RS Add-on - Sentinel-3 PUG processing chain

This chain contains the configuration for the processing chain of the Sentinel-3 PUG Processor. It is processing the outputs of the Sentinel-3 chains L0, L1, and L2 and creates the Product Dissemination Units (PDU) products, that shall be provided to end users. These products also function as the entry point to the short-time-critical (STC) and non-time-critical (NTC) processing workflows.
